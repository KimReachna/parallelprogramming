    "Measuring the working time is not as trivial as it seems at first glance. In the Julia language, it is further complicated by the fact that the compilation stage is hidden from the user. It occurs at the first start of the program and can take a long time, so to properly measure the running time, you should follow the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate the code whose performance you want to measure into a separate function\n",
    "* Always measure the operation of this function, not the entire program\n",

    "## Task 1\n",
    "Any program that uses parallel computing makes sense only if it runs faster than a program that does the same thing, but sequentially. So it is extremely important to measure the execution time. Before measuring the running time of parallel programs, it is necessary to learn how to correctly measure the running time of sequential programs. In Julia, the task is facilitated by the availability of ready-made functions and macros for these purposes.\n",
    "* Write a simple routine that waits for some time, for example 1 second. To wait, use the built-in ```sleep``` function. Is it possible to pass fractional values to it? Read the help of the ```time_ns``` function and replace the ```sleep``` function with it.\n",
    "* Measure the operation time of the function 10 times by printing out the results. Use ```@time```. Is the execution time different or is it the same all the time?\n",
    "* Take time measurements for ```1E6``` launches. You won't be able to wait one second, so replace ```sleep``` with ```time_ns```. Measure the running time of the program, print it out as a dot cloud (scatter) and a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the time, you can use ```BenchmarkTools```, which can build histograms of the running time of functions, but you need to figure out how it works."
